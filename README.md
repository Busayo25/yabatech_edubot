# ðŸ¤– YabatechEduBot

A hybrid educational chatbot built with Streamlit that answers questions about Yabatech admissions, courses, fees, and more.  
It combines semantic similarity matching with OpenAI's GPT-4 to intelligently handle both known and unseen questions.

---

## Features

- **Semantic Search:** Matches user questions against a large dataset of predefined intents for quick, accurate answers.  
- **GPT-4 Fallback:** Uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 API to generate natural, relevant responses for unseen or complex questions.  
- **Streamlit UI:** Simple and interactive web interface accessible on desktop and mobile.  
- **Secure API Key Handling:** Uses environment variables and Streamlit Secrets to securely manage OpenAI API keys.

Project Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ app.py            # Main Streamlit app with semantic + GPT-4 logic
â”œâ”€â”€ intents.json      # Dataset of predefined questions and responses
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt  # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore        # Files to ignore in Git
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md         # This file

How It Works

1. User inputs a question in the UI.


2. The app tries to find a matching question using sentence-transformers semantic similarity.


3. If a confident match is found, it returns the matched answer.


4. If not, it sends the question to OpenAI GPT-4 and returns the AI-generated answer.
